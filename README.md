# final-project
This is my final project for DATA 824. It is an app using the "billionaires.csv" dataset, which was found on kaggle.com. The dataset is a record of worldwide billionaire data, including billionaire name, net worth, country, industry, and other details. The app shows a by-country breakdown of the distribution of billionaire net worth across 6 wealth categories and a dynamic table of other country and billionaire data. For the purpose of the project, I utilized only the 10 countries with the highest number of billionaires in the population.
